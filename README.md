# The Pig Game

Hello there,

Here you will find a game of dice. :game_die:

You have two players, **player 1** and **player 2** who each their turn will *draw dice*.

The goal being to **hold** the maximum of point in its camp :inbox_tray: and reach a maximum of **100 points to win the game**.

The **player 1** :man::woman: begins the game and if one of the two players **fall** on the throw of **dice 1** that will pass the turn to the other player :repeat_one:, and if you did not **hold** your points before falling on the **dice 1**, in this case you will **lose** your points *accumulated* during your turn. :triumph:

The *dice* are generated in a totally random way with the **Math.random()* method. 

This game **highlights** the **manipulation of the dom** with **JavaScript**, we get the *classes* we want to *modify* with **getElementById** or **querySelector**.

A **switchPlayer function** allows us to *display* the current player's turn, with the **classlist.toggle()** method we *display* the current player with the **active** class in *CSS*. :fire:

Test with **friends** and see who can be the **first** to reach **100 points**. :trollface:

The design of this page is realized with :

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript for the manipulation of the dom
